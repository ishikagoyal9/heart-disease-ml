# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical data.

## Project Overview
The dataset includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. Various ML algorithms are applied to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling
- Model training using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations for exploratory data analysis and model results

## Getting Started
